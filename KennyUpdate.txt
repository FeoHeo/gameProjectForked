Appliance.h and .cpp - see if can make update(...), player_collide as pure virtual
                       base class for Bowl, Dishwasher, Stove
                            -> need virtual: reset(), player_collide(...), draw(...) [[or just not include draw(...)]]

ApplianceManager.h and .cpp - a lot to be done

Bin.h and .cpp - Kenny: done
           player_collide(...): Ansh and Seth need to fix this
                                Because the Player need to not go over anything
                                And the Position is realted to the map you guys design
           draw(...): Ansh and Seth learn to render sfml

Bench.h and .cpp - Kenny: almost done
                        Ansh and Seth: work on the rendering in update(...) and draw(...)

Bowl.h and .cpp - only make one bowl
           set_content(int content): the cout need to use sfml
           player_collide(...): Ansh and Seth need to fix this
                                Because the Player need to not go over anything
                                And the Position is realted to the map you guys design
           draw(...): Ansh and Seth learn to render sfml
           Kenny: need to delete comment
                            0: empty bowl
                            -1: dirty bowl
                            15, 21, 33, 23: bowl with soup
           Kenny: in reset() need to reset the position of the Bowl
                  in Bowl() neef to set the position for the Bowl

Dishwasher.h and .cpp - only have one
            player_collide(...): Ansh and Seth need to fix this
                                So choose an area that the Player need to be in to active the Dishwasher
            update(...): Ansh and Seth need to fix this
                        All the cout need to be rendered in sfml
                        Kenny: need to figure out the 2 seconds thing
                                Otherwise just ignore it

Stove.h and .cpp - only have one
            player_collide(...): Ansh and Seth need to fix this
                                So choose an area that the Player need to be in to active the Stove
            update(...): Ansh and Seth need to fix this
                        All the cout need to be rendered in sfml
                        Kenny: need to figure out the 3 seconds thing
                                Otherwise just ignore it

Player.h and .cpp - many to work on 
                reset(): Ansh and Seth choose the position of the Player
                update(...): Kenny: fix the part where allow the Player move as long as the key is held
                draw(...): Ansh and Seth
                        be careful of how you guys render the Player
                        Player will have a lot of states
                            0: empty hand
                            -1: carry dirty bowl
                            1: carry empty bowl
                            5: carry Mushroom
                            7: carry Onion
                            11: carry Tomato
                            15, 21, 33, 23: carry bowl with soup

                set_direction(...), set_dead(...), get_animation_over(), set_am_I_dead(...), get_am_I_dead()
                    -> Kenny: check if need these
                Kenny: add in score count

Position.h - Kenny: check the equal operator function
                Ansh and Seth: decide the map size, speed, animation frame

Order.h and .cpp - use randi()

Mushroom.h and .cpp (also onion and tomato) - Kenny: done
                                                Ansh and Seth: fixed up the rendering them
